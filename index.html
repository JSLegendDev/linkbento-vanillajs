      <h2>What is link bento?</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by the japanese lunch box called "bento" the idea is to make a "lunch box" of carefully selected links that you send
        to your friends or family with a single link.

      <p>In addition to selecting links you can leave a message for every link you decide to include and for the link bento as well</p>
