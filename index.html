        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by the japanese lunch box called "bento" the idea is to make a "lunch box" of carefully selected links that you send
          to your friends or family with a single link. 
        </p>
        <p>In addition to selecting links you can leave a message for every link you decide to include and for the link bento as well.</p>
